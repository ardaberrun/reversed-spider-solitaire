## How To Play

 - The goal in this game is to remove all cards from the table by creating "series" of cards. Each series must be arranged in ascending order from Ace to King.
 - In this game, aces are big, kings are small. You can create series of cards by moving cards between stacks as long as they are in the proper order. (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K)
 - To move a card, tap and pull the card.
 - If you have an empty column, you can place any card or a sequential cards in that column. There is no limit to how many cards you can carry at once!
 - If you have no more moves to make, deal a new cards by tapping the draw pile in the lower left corner. YOU CANNOT DEAL CARDS WHILE ANY COLUMNS ARE EMPTY!

## Tips

 - As aces can only be placed on empty columns, they can block the cards you need. Try to get rid of the aces as quickly as possible.
 - Try to open the face cards as quickly as possible. Turning down cards is a good way to create an empty column as it reveals a new set of possible moves.
 - You start with 500 points. Each move deducts 1 point from your total score. Each completed deck adds 100 points.
